# WebSecurity

## Description

This is a project for my school. The topic is about web security and most common cyber-attacks.
## SSO

The sso is a demo project to show how single sign on works. I can't publish everything because it contains personal data which is shown on the page itself. And i don't want to give my school login to everyone. I censored all data and School specific things i is working if you fill out the TODO comments correctly.

## WebAuthN

This project is a small standalone project that showcases the principe of WebAuthn. It's a simple page where you can sing in with a username and a auto generated passkey which is managed from your password manager. (windows hello, google ...)
